Aooshi.SnowFlake
===================

C# implementation of Twitter's Snowflake. A Generator can create sequentially unique IDs with a length of 8 bytes.  
The ID consists of a timestamp (milliseconds since specific start date), a generator id and a sequence.

This is the default configuration:

- 41 bits for timestamp in milliseconds (can vary from 40 to 45)
- 10 bits for generator id (can vary from 0 to 10)
- 13 bits for sequence (can vary from 12 to 20)

You can change this default values to gain more performance on a single process (more sequence-bits) or more performance in a cluster (more generator-bits).  
With the default configuration you can create 1024 different generators. Each generator can create up to 8192 unique IDs per millisecond for 69 years.

Usage
-----

First, grab the assembly from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aooshi.SnowFlake/).

```csharp
// Create a new instance of the generator
var generator = new Generator(machineId, projectStartDate);
    
// get a new id
generator.Next();
```
